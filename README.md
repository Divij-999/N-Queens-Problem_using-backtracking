# N-Queen Problem Solver

## Overview
The N-queen problem is a classic problem in the field of computer science and combinatorial optimization. The objective is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally without limit, so no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project provides a Python implementation to solve the N-queen problem using algorithms such as backtracking.

## Feautures
### Customizable Board Size:
    Users can define the size of the chessboard (N) to solve the N-queen problem for different dimensions.

### Visualizations:
    Visualization of the solutions generated by algorithm, providing insight into how the queens are placed on the board.

## Dependencies
-> Python 3.x <br />
